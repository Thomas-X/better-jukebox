# Better Jukeboxes
Makes Jukeboxes a lot more useful and fun to have!

## Features
* The Jukebox will now emit a redstone signal of 15 when it's ON, and will turn off after the record has been played. 
   * This is imperfect (custom discs are not supported right now) but allows you to easily cycle through the Jukebox when it's done playing a record
* Makes hopper/conduits able to access Jukebox inventory

## Example setup

(there's a hopper behind the iron block on the bottom)
This will cycle through records until they're all played. You could loop it by looping the items back into the top hopper.
